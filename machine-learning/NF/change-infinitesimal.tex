\section{Change of infinitesimal volume}

I will only discuss the scalar case. Let $z \in \mathbb R$ and $z = t(h)$ for $h \in \mathbb R$, then
\begin{equation}
    \dv{a}{b} = \dv{t(b)}{b}
\end{equation}
and therefore
\begin{equation}
    \dd a = \dv{t(b)}{b} \dd b
\end{equation}
where $\dv{t(b)}{b}$ is the determinant of the Jacobian of the scalar transformation. 
All we really need is to scale the volume (the direction does not matter), thus we use the absolute value
\begin{equation}
    \dd a = \abs{\dv{t(b)}{b}} \dd b ~.
\end{equation}
I know I am being very informal here, but this ``rule'' should help you throughout. 
Then in high dimensions it becomes
\begin{equation}
    \dd x = \djac{t}{y} \dd y ~.
\end{equation}
